= Scaling the discovery process

Importing a large number of accounts to Workload Discovery on AWS can result in the discovery process
ingesting tens to hundreds of thousands of resources. To handle this volume of resources, it may be necessary
to increase the instance sizes of the databases and the memory allocation of the Amazon Elastic Container Service
(Amazon ECS) task that runs the discovery process.

== Increasing the DB instance sizes

=== Prerequisites

Before changing the instance sizes, first verify the CPU usage of the databases.

. Sign in to the https://console.aws.amazon.com/neptune/home[Amazon Neptune console].
. Choose the database with a DB identifier of *wdneptunedbcluster-<ID-string>*.
. Choose the *Monitoring* tab
. Verify that the CPU levels in the *CPU utilization* graph spike to above 75%.
. Sign in to the https://console.aws.amazon.com/aos/home[Amazon OpenSearch Service console].
. Choose *Domains* from the sidebar.
. Choose the domain named *opensearchdomai-<ID-string>*.
. Choose the *Cluster health* tab.
. Scroll to the *Data nodes* panel.
. Verify that the CPU levels in the *CPU utilization* graph spike to above 75%.

=== Increasing the database instance sizes

To increase the DB instance sizes:

. Sign in to the https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation[CloudFormation console].
. Select the main Workload Discovery stack radio button (it will have a description containing the text
`Workload Discovery on AWS Main Template(SO0075a) - Solution - Main Template`)
. Choose *Update*
. On the *Update stack* page choose *Next*.
. On the *Specify stack details* page change the following parameters:
.. To increase the Neptune instance size, change *NeptuneInstanceClass* to an instance size double the previous
value, e.g., db.r5.large -> db.r5.2xlarge
.. To increase the OpenSearch instance size, change *OpensearchInstanceType* to an instance size double the previous
value, e.g., m6g.large.search -> m6g.2xlarge.search
. On the *Configure stack options* page, choose *Next*.
. On the *Review* page, check the checkboxes in the *Capabilities* panel and choose *Next*.

It may take up to half an hour for the database instance sizes to fully update.

Once the stack update is complete, allow the discovery process to run and follow the steps in the Prerequisites
to verify that the CPU usage has reduced. If it has not, repeat the steps to increase the database size again.

[NOTE]
====
The initial ingestion of multiple accounts in a single run of the Discovery process is a write-heavy process,
requiring more CPU resources from the database. Once these resources have been ingested, it is often possible to
reduce the instance type size of databases. Follow the steps in the *Prerequisite* section to monitor the CPU usage â€”
if it is consistently below 50% then you may lower the instance class type.

== Increasing the Fargate task memory allocation

The Amazon ECS task may run out of memory and be terminated prematurely when the discovery process is ingesting
large numbers of resources.

=== Prerequisites
. Sign in to the https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home[Amazon Elastic
Container Service console].
. Select the cluster named *workload-discovery-cluster*.
. Choose the *Tasks* tab.
. Select the *Stopped* button in the *Desired task status* panel.
. In the *Last Status* column check for the error message `OutOfMemoryError: Container killed due to memory usage`.

=== Increasing the memory for the ECS task
. Sign in to the https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation[CloudFormation console].
. Select the main Workload Discovery stack radio button (it will have a description containing the text
`Workload Discovery on AWS Main Template(SO0075a) - Solution - Main Template`)
. Choose *Update*
. On the *Update stack* page choose *Next*.
. On the *Specify stack details* page change the following parameters:
.. To increase the memory allocation for the ECS task, change *Memory* to a value double the previous one.
.. To increase the CPU allocation for the ECS task, change *CpuUnits* to a value double the previous one.
This step is only necessary if you wish to allocate more than 8Gb of memory to the task. The allowed memory and CPU
combinations for Fargate tasks can be found https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS_Fargate.html#fargate-tasks-size[here].
. On the *Configure stack options* page, choose *Next*.
. On the *Review* page, check the checkboxes in the *Capabilities* panel and choose *Next*.

[NOTE]
====
Depending on the amount of resources being ingested, you may have to repeat this process more than once to find the
correct memory size for the ECS task.
